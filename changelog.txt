
	REHASH CHANGELOG

* means change, bugfix or just a plain note
+ means addition

==============================================================================
Version 0.2 - 2003-10-18
+ Added check if filename pattern is valid
* Safer definitions for UWORDX
+ Added variable types check to the selftest routine
+ Added possibility to output filenames only instead of full paths
* Filenames in text output are now enclosed by <>
* Fixed all system-dependent variable types (like int and long) by using
  system-independent types (like UWORD32 and UWORD64)
+ Introduced UINTPREF and INTPREF types which represent the fastest integers
  (for example for a 64-bit compiler INTPREF will be a 64-bit signed integer)
* Renamed some algorithms and short names to more convenient names
* Faster output (the output is buffered in a string and then printf'ed once
  in the hash output routines)

==============================================================================
Version 0.1 - 2003-10-03
